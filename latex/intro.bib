YesWorkflow captures prospective provenance declared through annotations in the comments of scripts, and supports key retrospective provenance queries by observing what files were used or produced by the script. We demonstrate how combining complementary information gathered by noWorkflow and YesWorkflow enables provenance queries and data lineage visualizations neither tool can provide on its own.",
